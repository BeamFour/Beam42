# JFotoptix

This is work-in-progress Java port of https://github.com/dibyendumajumdar/goptical.

## Why?

The C++ code base is hard to maintain, refactor or change.
There is no real benefit to using C++ for Goptical, apart from availability of numeric libraries. 
But since everything used by the version I maintain is self contained, there are no external dependencies
to worry about.

I chose Java as the language as it is the quickest option for me to 
port to, but Kotlin would be nice as it will allow targeting JavaScript or the JVM.

C# is another option.

## License

The software is ported from Goptical, hence the original license applies.
