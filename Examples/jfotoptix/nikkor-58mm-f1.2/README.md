# Noct Nikkor 58mm f1.2

This is an ongoing attempt to reverse engineer the specs for the Noct Nikkor.

The goal is to get to a similar MTF measurement obtained from https://photo.imx.nl/technique/technique/hslenses.html.

The spec was reverse engineered from [Service Manual Noct Schema](./noct4.png).
However, the resulting dimensions have some issues, for instance according to [this](./noct1.png) the distance to
aperture stop should be 8.5mm.
The effective focal length is 62.1 instead of 58.
The principal focal points H and H' are incorrect too.
It seems that the diagrams we have available may not be accurate which makes it very hard to reproduce the specs.
